# gitUpdateListener

This program checks if a certain branch on git is behind and in case it is, it updates (pulls) it. 
After pulling it can run a bash script (copy files and restart server, whatever you want).

In the end a specified list of emailaddresses get a notification about the update

You have to setup the configuration in the config.properties file in order for the program to run, simply copy the example properties and rename them.

[x] setup Maven <br>
[x] setup git with gitignore <br>
[x] open Repo <br>
[x] check for updates on branch <br>
[x] execute bash script <br>
[x] add email notification <br>


I am glad to help if any problems occurr
