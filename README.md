# gitUpdateListener

This program checks if a certain branch on git is behind and in case it is, it updates it. 
After updating it can run a bash script

You have to setup the configuration in the config.properties file in order for the program to run

[x] setup Maven <br>
[x] setup git with gitignore <br>
[x] open Repo <br>
[x] check for updates on branch <br>
[x] execute bash script <br>
[x] add email notification <br>


I am glad to help if any problems occur
